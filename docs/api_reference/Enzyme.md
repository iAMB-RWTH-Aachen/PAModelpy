Classes related to enzymes:
- Enzyme: Constraints relating enzymes to reactions. Including upper and lower bound enzyme constraints
- EnzymeVariable: Variable related to an enzyme. The value of this variable represent the concentration.

## Enzyme Objects

```python
class Enzyme(Object)
```

Upper level Enzyme object containing information about the enzyme and links to the EnzymeVariables for each reaction the enzyme catalyzes.

**Arguments**:

  - id (str): Identifier for the enzyme (e.g., Uniprot ID).
  - rxn2kcat (Dict): Dictionary with reaction ID, kcat value pairs for the forward (f) and backward (b) reaction,
  e.g. `{'PGI': {'f': 30, 'b': 0.1}}`
  - upper_bound (float): Upper bound for the enzyme variable (default 1000.0).
  - lower_bound (float): Lower bound for the enzyme variable (default 0).
  - name (str): Name of the enzyme (default None).
  - molmass (float): Molar mass of the enzyme (default 3.947778784340140e04).
  

**Notes**:

  - This class is used to generate enzyme instances from kcat values and contains information about the forward as well as the backward catalysis.
  - The enzyme is linked to individual cobra.Reaction variables with CatalyticEvent objects.
  - There are two scenarios:
  - Promiscuous enzymes: a single enzyme can catalyze multiple reactions.
  - Other: a single enzyme catalyzes a single reaction.

## EnzymeVariable Objects

```python
class EnzymeVariable(Reaction)
```

EnzymeVariable is a class for holding information regarding the variable representing an enzyme in the model.
For each reaction, the enzyme variables are summarized in a CatalyticEvent.

There are three different scenarios:
- Enzyme complex: multiple enzymes together are associated with an EnzymeComplex object.
- Isozymes: multiple enzymes independently associated with a single catalytic event.
- Other: a single enzyme is associated with a single catalytic event.

**Arguments**:

- `kcats2rxns` _Dict_ - A dictionary with reaction_id, kcat key, value pairs to connect the enzyme with the associated reaction.
  The kcat is another dictionary with `f` and `b` for the forward and backward reactions, respectively.
- `id` _str, optional_ - The identifier to associate with this enzyme (default None).
- `name` _str, optional_ - A human-readable name for the enzyme (default &quot;&quot;).
- `subsystem` _str, optional_ - Subsystem where the enzyme is meant to function (default &quot;&quot;).
- `lower_bound` _float_ - The lower flux bound (default 0.0).
- `upper_bound` _float, optional_ - The upper flux bound (default None).
- `**kwargs` - Additional keyword arguments are passed on to the parent class.

#### DEFAULT\_ENZYME\_MOL\_MASS

mean enzymes mass E.coli [g/mol]

#### kcat\_values

```python
@property
def kcat_values()
```

Returns a dictionary with kcat values and reactions.

**Returns**:

- `dict` - A dictionary containing kcat values and their associated reactions.

#### flux

```python
@property
def flux() -> float
```

Get the flux value in the most recent solution.

Flux is the primal value of the corresponding variable in the model.

**Returns**:

- `float` - Flux, which is the primal value of the corresponding variable in the model.
  

**Raises**:

- `RuntimeError` - If the underlying model was never optimized beforehand or the reaction is not part of a model.
- `OptimizationError` - If the solver status is anything other than &#x27;optimal&#x27;.
- `AssertionError` - If the flux value is not within the bounds.
  

**Warnings**:

  - Accessing reaction fluxes through a `Solution` object is the safer, preferred, and only guaranteed to be correct way.
  - Reaction flux is retrieved from the currently defined `self._model.solver`. The solver status is checked but there are no guarantees that the current solver state is the one you are looking for.
  - If you modify the underlying model after an optimization, you will retrieve the old optimization values.
  

**Examples**:

    ```
    >>> from cobra.io import load_model
    >>> model = load_model("textbook")
    >>> solution = model.optimize()
    >>> model.variables.PFK.flux
    7.477381962160283
    >>> solution.fluxes.PFK
    7.4773819621602833
    ```

#### concentration

```python
@property
def concentration() -> float
```

Get the enzyme concentration value of the most recent solution.

The enzyme concentration equals the flux value.

**Returns**:

- `float` - Enzyme concentration in mmol/gDW.

#### add\_catalytic\_events

  enzyme with the associated reaction. The kcat is another dictionary with `f` and `b` for the forward and
