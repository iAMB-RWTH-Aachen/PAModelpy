class PAModel(Model):
    """
    Class representation for a cobra model extended with enzyme kinetics as published in Alter et al. (2021).

    Parameters:
        id_or_model (str or Model): String to use as model id, or actual model to base new model on.
            If a string, it is used as input to load a model from. If a model, a new model object is instantiated with
            the same properties as the original model (default None).
        name (str, optional): Human-readable string to be model description (default None).
        p_tot (float, optional): Total protein concentration (condition-dependent) (unit g_prot/g_cdw) (default 0.285).
        senstitivity (bool): Boolean value whether or not a sensitivity analysis should be performed during each simulation.
            This sensitivity analysis will indicate to which extent individual constraints contribute to the objective value.
        Enzyme sectors (EnzymeSector objects, optional): Information about the different enzyme sectors, including:
            - Active_enzyme: Metabolic active proteins.
            - Transl_enzyme: Enzymes related to translation.
            - Unused_enzymes: Excess enzymes.
            - Custom_enzymes (list): Custom enzyme sectors.
        configuration (Config object, optional): Information about the general configuration of the model, including
            identifier conventions. Default as defined in the `PAModelpy.configuration` script for the E.coli iML1515 model.

    Attributes:
        p_tot (float): The fraction of biomass allocated to proteins (units: g_prot/g_cdw).
        reactions (DictList): A DictList where the key is the reaction identifier and the value is a Reaction.
        metabolites (DictList): A DictList where the key is the metabolite identifier and the value is a Metabolite.
        genes (DictList): A DictList where the key is the gene identifier and the value is a Gene.
        groups (DictList): A DictList where the key is the group identifier and the value is a Group.
        enzymes (DictList): A DictList where the key is the enzyme identifier and the value is an Enzyme.
        enzyme_variables (DictList): A DictList where the key is the enzyme variable identifier and the value is an EnzymeVariable.
        catalytic_events (DictList): A DictList where the key is the catalytic event identifier and the value is a CatalyticEvent.
        sector_constraints (dict): A dictionary containing sector-specific constraints.
        sectors (DictList): A DictList where the key is the sector identifier and the value is an EnzymeSector.

            fraction_of_optimum (float, optional): The fraction of optimum which must be maintained. The original objective reaction is constrained to be greater than the maximal value times the `fraction_of_optimum` (default 1.0).
            objective (dict or cobra.Model.objective, optional): A desired objective to use during optimization in addition to the pFBA objective. Dictionaries (reaction as the key, coefficient as the value) can be used for linear objectives (default None).
            proteins (bool, optional): Determines whether to include enzyme variables in the pFBA objective.
