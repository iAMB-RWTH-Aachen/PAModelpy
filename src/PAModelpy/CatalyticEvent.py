   CatalyticEvent is a class for holding information regarding the
        catalysis of a Reaction in a cobra.Model object. It serves as an interface
        between the metabolic reaction and the associated enzyme constraints and variables.

    Notes:
        There are three different scenarios:
        - Enzyme complex: multiple enzymes together are associated with an EnzymeComplex object
        - Isozymes: multiple enzymes independently associated with a single catalytic event
        - Other: a single enzyme is associated with a single catalytic event

    Parameters:
        kcats2enzymes (dict): A dictionary with enzyme, kcat key, value pairs to connect the enzyme with the associated reaction.
            The kcat is another dictionary with 'f' and 'b' for the forward and backward reactions, respectively.
        id (str, optional): The identifier to associate with this catalytic event (default None).
        rxn_id (str, optional): The reaction with which this catalytic event is associated.

        Warnings:
            * Accessing reaction fluxes through a `Solution` object is the safer,

            * If you modify the underlying model after an optimization, you will

        """
            Extracts the reaction ID from a catalytic reaction string by removing
            any associated protein IDs in various formats.

            The function identifies and strips off protein IDs from the input string.
            Protein IDs can be in one of two formats:
            1. Standard protein identifiers (by default Uniprot ids: e.g., 'P0ABJ1', 'Q1234X').
            2. Protein IDs for unknown enzymes in the format 'E<number>' (e.g., 'E1', 'E10', 'E534').

            If the string starts with 'CE_', the 'CE_' prefix is removed before processing.

            Args:
                input_str (str): The input string representing a catalytic reaction ID,
                    which may contain associated protein IDs.
                protein_id_pattern (str): Regular expression pattern for matching
                    standard protein IDs. Defaults to a UniProt-based regex.
                default_enzyme_id_pattern (str): Regular expression pattern for matching protein
                    IDs in the format 'E<number>' (e.g., 'E1', 'E99'). Defaults to 'E[0-9][0-9]*'.

            Returns:
                str: The extracted reaction ID with any protein IDs removed.

            Examples:
                >>> _extract_reaction_id_from_catalytic_reaction_id('CE_CYTBO3_4pp_P0ABJ1_P0ABJ5_E123')
                'CYTBO3_4pp'

                >>> _extract_reaction_id_from_catalytic_reaction_id('CE_REACTID_E1_E534')
                'REACTID'

                >>> _extract_reaction_id_from_catalytic_reaction_id('LPLIPAL2ATE140_E3')
                'LPLIPAL2ATE140'

            Notes:
                - The function will strip protein IDs from both the standard format
                  (e.g., 'P0ABJ1', 'Q1234X') and the 'E<number>' format.
                - If no valid protein ID is found, the reaction ID is returned as-is.
                - The function assumes that valid reaction IDs are located at the
                  beginning of the string or after the 'CE_' prefix.
